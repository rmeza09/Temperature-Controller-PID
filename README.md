Hello everyone,

I am working on creating a compact temperature controlling system with a flexible heater and a J type thermocouple.
I am writing and tuning my own PID controller and developing the mechatronics hardware as part of this project.
I will also finally desing a portable housing that can be connected to the heater, thermocouple and power source to control the system.

This is part of an effort to have controlled heating on a surface for benchtop testing.

Incuded is the arduino code to control I/O and the PID controller.
