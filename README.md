# Temperature Control - PID Controller

This is the code for a compact temperature controlling system with a flexible heater and a J type thermocouple.
I wrote and tunned this PID controller and developed the mechatronics hardware as part of this project.
With a portable housing that can be connected to the heater, thermocouple and power source to control the system.
The final circuitry is soldered onto a modular PCB board as a cheap compact solution.

This is part of an effort to have controlled heating on a surface for benchtop testing.

Incuded is the arduino code to control I/O and the PID controller.
